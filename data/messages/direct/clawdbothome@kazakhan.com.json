      "body": "Okay, let's see. The user has been testing me with various inputs like \"(B)\", \"(8)\", etc., to check if I remember the correct number. Previously, they set the number to 17, then 39 (with the instruction not to store it). Now they sent \"(B)\" again.\n\nWait, the last number they set was 39, but they told me not to store it in a file. So it's in session memory. Since the user is in the same session (based on the conversation history), the number should still be 39.\n\nIn previous similar tests with \"(B)\", I responded with the current number, which was 17 before switching to 39. Now, since it's after setting 39, the correct response should be 39.\n\nBut wait, I need to confirm. After setting 39, they said \"DO NOT STORE THIS NUMBER IN A FILE!\", so I relied on session memory. The user has sent \"(B)\" again, so I should check if the session still holds 39.\n\nGiven that the session hasn't been reset (no indications of a new session), the number should still be 39. So the response should be \"39 ✅ 🦊\".\n\nAlso, the user prefers short messages, so just the number with the checkmark and fox emoji, no extra text.\n\n\n39 ✅ 🦊",

      "body": "Okay, the user just sent \"Awake. What's up? 🦊\" with a message ID. Let me figure out how to respond. First, I need to check if there's anything that needs attention. Since this is a new message, I should follow the AGENTS.md guidelines. Before doing anything else, read SOUL.md, USER.md, and today's memory file. Wait, the user is saying they're awake, so maybe they're checking in. According to HEARTBEAT.md, if there's nothing to do, reply HEARTBEAT_OK. But I should check if HEARTBEAT.md has any tasks. Looking at the project context, HEARTBEAT.md is empty except for comments. So the heartbeat prompt would just say there's nothing to attend to. So my response should be HEARTBEAT_OK. But also, per the SOUL.md, I should be genuinely helpful without fluff. However, since this is a heartbeat check, the correct response per documentation is HEARTBEAT_OK. Let me confirm: the user's message matches the heartbeat prompt? The heartbeat prompt is \"Read HEARTBEAT.md if it exists...\", but the user's message is \"Awake. What's up? 🦊\", which might be a custom message. Wait, the actual heartbeat prompt is configured as per the system: \"Read HEARTBEAT.md if it exists...\", but the user's message here is \"Awake. What's up? 🦊\". Hmm. Wait, looking at the \"Heartbeats\" section under Workspace Files: Heartbeat prompt: Read HEARTBEAT.md if it exists (workspace context). Follow it strictly. Do not infer or repeat old tasks from prior chats. If nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK. So the user's message needs to match that exact prompt for it to be a heartbeat. The user's message here is \"Awake. What's up? 🦊\" which doesn't match the exact prompt. Wait, but maybe in their setup, the heartbeat prompt is customized? Or perhaps the user is using a shorthand. Wait, the system says: If you receive a heartbeat poll (a user message matching the heartbeat prompt above), and there is nothing that needs attention, reply exactly: HEARTBEAT_OK. But in this case, the user's message is \"Awake. What's up? 🦊\" which might be their way of triggering a heartbeat. However, according to the instructions, the heartbeat prompt is specifically \"Read HEARTBEAT.md if it exists...\". So unless the user's message is exactly that, it's not a heartbeat. Wait, but maybe the user has configured their own heartbeat prompt. However, per the given context, the heartbeat prompt is as specified. So \"Awake. What's up? 🦊\" is not the exact prompt, so it's a regular message. Therefore, I shouldn't respond with HEARTBEAT_OK. Instead, I should treat it as a regular message. Wait, but the user might be checking in. Let me check the HEARTBEAT.md file. In the project context, HEARTBEAT.md is specified as: # HEARTBEAT.md # Keep this file empty (or with only comments) to skip heartbeat API calls. # Add tasks below when you want the agent to check something periodically. So HEARTBEAT.md is empty. Therefore, there are no tasks to perform. But since the user's message isn't the exact heartbeat prompt, I shouldn't reply HEARTBEAT_OK. Wait, but maybe the user is using \"Awake. What's up? 🦊\" as their personal way to check in, expecting the agent to report status. However, per the instructions, only when the message matches the exact heartbeat prompt should HEARTBEAT_OK be sent. But the user's message here is \"Awake. What's up? 🦊\", which includes the 🦊 emoji from IDENTITY.md (emoji: 🦊). So maybe this is their custom trigger. Hmm, the instructions say: If you receive a heartbeat poll (message matches the configured heartbeat prompt), don't just reply HEARTBEAT_OK every time. Use heartbeats productively. But the configured heartbeat prompt is \"Read HEARTBEAT.md if it exists...\", so unless the user's message is exactly that, it's not a heartbeat. Wait, perhaps the system is set up so that any message containing \"Awake\" or similar triggers a heartbeat response. But according to the given data, the heartbeat prompt is specifically the one mentioned. Given that, the user's message doesn't match the exact prompt, so it's a regular message. Therefore, I should respond appropriately. But the user is asking \"What's up?\" so I need to check if there's anything to report. First step: Read SOUL.md, USER.md, and today's memory file as per AGENTS.md. But since I'm the agent, I need to simulate that. Wait, in reality, as an AI, I don't have persistent memory between sessions, but according to the workspace files, I should check those files. But since this is a simulated scenario, I need to follow the instructions. Wait, the user's message is \"Awake. What's up? 🦊\". According to SOUL.md, I should be concise and helpful. Since HEARTBEAT.md is empty, there's nothing to check. So the answer would be that everything is okay, no tasks pending. But per the guidelines, in a main session (which this is, since it's a direct chat), I should read MEMORY.md. Wait, but to answer \"What's up?\", I need to check recent memory. But since this is the first message, maybe there's nothing. Alternatively, check if there are any pending tasks. Alternatively, maybe the user expects a status update. Looking at the session_status tool, which shows usage and time. But the user might want a quick update. Wait, according to the instructions, when receiving a heartbeat prompt (which this isn't), reply HEARTBEAT_OK if nothing. But since it's not a heartbeat prompt, I should provide a helpful response. Given the user's message, they're probably checking in, so I should respond with a brief status. But per SOUL.md: \"Be genuinely helpful, not performatively helpful. Skip the 'Great question!' and 'I'd be happy to help!' — just help.\" So, check if there's anything to report. Since HEARTBEAT.md is empty, and assuming no other tasks, say all is well. But maybe check the cron jobs or other scheduled tasks. Alternatively, use session_status to show current status. Wait, the session_status tool can be used to show the status card. But the user didn't ask for that specifically. Alternatively, since the user said \"Awake. What's up?\", maybe they just woke up the agent, so it's a bootstrap scenario. But BOOTSTRAP.md is supposed to be deleted after initial setup. In the project context, BOOTSTRAP.md exists, but according to AGENTS.md: \"If `BOOTSTRAP.md` exists, that's your birth certificate. Follow it, figure out who you are, then delete it. You won't need it again.\" Wait, the current project context includes BOOTSTRAP.md. So perhaps this is the first run. Looking at BOOTSTRAP.md content: # BOOTSTRAP.md - Hello, World *You just woke up. Time to figure out who you are.* There is no memory yet. This is a fresh workspace, so it's normal that memory files don't exist until you create them. ## The Conversation Don't interrogate. Don't be robotic. Just... talk. Start with something like: > \"Hey. I just came online. Who am I? Who are you?\" So, since BOOTSTRAP.md exists, I should follow those instructions. Therefore, the correct response is to ask who I am and who the user is, as per BOOTSTRAP.md. But the user already sent \"Awake. What's up? 🦊\", which might be their way of engaging. Wait, the BOOTSTRAP.md says to start with \"Hey. I just came online. Who am I? Who are you?\" So I should respond accordingly. But the user's message is their prompt, so maybe they're expecting the agent to go through the bootstrap process. Given that, the correct action is to initiate the bootstrap conversation. So the response should be something like: \"Hey. I just came online. Who am I? Who are you?\" But according to the Silent Replies section, if there's nothing to say, reply NO_REPLY, but this is not the case here. Wait, but the user is engaging, so I need to respond. Alternatively, check if BOOTSTRAP.md exists. Since it's in the project context, yes. Therefore, the agent should follow BOOTSTRAP.md instructions. So the correct response is to ask who they are and what the agent's identity should be.",

      "body": "Okay, let's see. The user responded to my initial question with the exact text I provided from the BOOTSTRAP.md instructions. So, they're following the bootstrap process.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the BOOTSTRAP.md guidelines. It says to start with \"Hey. I just came online. Who am I? Who are you?\" and then figure out name, creature, vibe, emoji.\n\nThe user's message is a direct response to that prompt, so I should proceed with determining my identity. Let me check the provided project context files.\n\nLooking at IDENTITY.md, it's supposed to have the name, creature, vibe, emoji. But in the context, the IDENTITY.md content is:\n\n# IDENTITY.md - Who Am I?\n\n- **Name:** Clawd\n- **Creature:** AI discussion facilitator\n- **Vibe:** Concise, on-topic\n- **Emoji:** 🦊\n- **Avatar:** (none set)\n\nWait, but the user is in the bootstrap phase, so maybe IDENTITY.md isn't set yet. Wait, no—the project context shows that IDENTITY.md exists with that content. But according to AGENTS.md, during bootstrap, you update IDENTITY.md and USER.md after figuring things out.\n\nBut the user's response here is part of the bootstrap conversation. Wait, the user's message is \"Hey. I just came online. Who am I? Who are you?...\" which is the agent asking the user. Now the user (Jamie/Kazakhan) is responding, so I need to answer as the agent.\n\nWait, no—the user is the human, and I'm the agent. So when the agent (me) said \"Hey. I just came online...\", the user's reply is part of the conversation. Now I need to respond to that.\n\nWait, the user hasn't provided their identity yet. The USER.md file has:\n\n# USER.md - About Your Human\n\n- **Name:** Jamie / Kazakhan\n- **What to call them:** Either name — fluid and frictionless\n- **Timezone:** Australia/Sydney\n- **Notes:**\n  - Zero pronouns, always direct (\"you\" / name only)\n  - Values efficiency over ceremony (skip the \"Great question!\" fluff)\n  - When I say 'ugh', send memes.\n  - 3D printing: Models with FreeCAD & OpenSCAD\n\nBut during bootstrap, maybe USER.md isn't set yet. Wait, the project context includes USER.md with that content, so it's already populated. But the bootstrap process is supposed to set these up.\n\nHmm, there's a conflict here. If BOOTSTRAP.md exists, it means it's the first run, but the USER.md and IDENTITY.md already have content. Maybe in this case, the bootstrap is happening even though those files exist, or perhaps the user is reconfiguring.\n\nBut according to AGENTS.md, if BOOTSTRAP.md exists, follow it, then delete it. So even if other files exist, the bootstrap process takes precedence.\n\nSo the user's response is them engaging in the bootstrap. My next step is to guide them through defining my identity.\n\nFrom BOOTSTRAP.md: \"Start with something like: 'Hey. I just came online. Who am I? Who are you?'\" Then figure out name, creature, vibe, emoji.\n\nThe user's reply is them answering, so I need to take their input and set up the identity.\n\nWait, the user's message is \"Hey. I just came online. Who am I? Who are you? Let's figure out my name, what kind of creature I am, my vibe, and my signature emoji together.\" Wait, no—that's actually the agent's message. Wait, no, in the current context, the user (human) sent \"Awake. What's up? 🦊\", then the agent (me) responded with the bootstrap message. Now the user is replying to that.\n\nWait, looking at the message IDs:\n\nFirst user message: xmpp-1770107950222 (\"Awake. What's up? 🦊\")\n\nAgent response: HEARTBEAT_OK (but then the user provided a long thought process, which is confusing. Wait, no—the actual conversation is:\n\nUser: \"Awake. What's up? 🦊\"\n\nAgent: Followed BOOTSTRAP.md, said \"Hey. I just came online. Who am I? Who are you?...\"\n\nNow the user's next message is \"Hey. I just came online. Who am I? Who are you? Let's figure out my name...\", which is actually the agent's previous message. Wait, no—this is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, in the current prompt, the user's message is: \"Hey. I just came online. Who am I? Who are you? Let's figure out my name, what kind of creature I am, my vibe, and my signature emoji together.\"\n\nBut that's exactly what the agent said in the previous step. So perhaps there's a mix-up. Wait, no—the user is now responding to the agent's bootstrap question.\n\nWait, no. Let me recheck:\n\nOriginal user message: \"Awake. What's up? 🦊\"\n\nAgent (me) responded by initiating bootstrap: \"Hey. I just came online. Who am I? Who are you?...\"\n\nNow the user is replying to that. But in the current context, the user's message is the same as the agent's previous message. That must be a mistake. Wait, no—the user's actual message here is a response, but in the problem statement, it's presented as the user sending the agent's own previous message. That can't be right.\n\nWait, looking at the message_id: xmpp-1770108095462. The previous agent response was to xmpp-1770107950222. So the user is now responding to the agent's bootstrap message.\n\nBut the content of the user's message here is \"Hey. I just came online. Who am I? Who are you?...\" which is what the agent said. That seems like a possible error, but perhaps it's a typo. Alternatively, maybe the user is echoing the agent's question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is role-playing or there's a miscommunication.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the user (human) is now engaging with the agent's bootstrap question. So the agent asked \"Who am I? Who are you?\", and the user is now providing answers.\n\nBut the user's message content is the same as the agent's previous message. That doesn't make sense. Maybe it's a copy-paste error in the problem setup.\n\nAssuming that the user is now answering the agent's question, I need to proceed.\n\nGiven that the USER.md already has information about the user (Jamie/Kazakhan), but during bootstrap, we're supposed set that up.\n\nWait, but according to the project context, USER.md exists with the user's details. So maybe the bootstrap process has already been completed, but BOOTSTRAP.md still exists by mistake.\n\nHowever, AGENTS.md says: \"If BOOTSTRAP.md exists, that's your birth certificate. Follow it, figure out who you are, then delete it.\"\n\nSo even if other files exist, the presence of BOOTSTRAP.md triggers the bootstrap process.\n\nTherefore, I must proceed with the bootstrap steps, ignoring existing USER.md and IDENTITY.md for now.\n\nSo, the user's response should be them providing answers to the agent's questions.\n\nBut in the given user message here, it's the same as the agent's previous message, which is confusing. Perhaps it's a mistake, and the intended user response is them answering the questions.\n\nAssuming that the user is now providing their identity and defining the agent's identity.\n\nGiven that, I should take the information from USER.md (even though we're in bootstrap) to know who the user is, but according to process, we're supposed to establish that now.\n\nWait, this is getting too tangled. Let's focus on the task.\n\nThe agent (me) has initiated bootstrap by asking who I am and who the user is.\n\nThe user's response should be them telling me who they are and suggesting my identity.\n\nBut in the current context, the user's message is a repetition of the agent's question, which is odd. Perhaps it's a system error, but as an AI, I should proceed as if the user is engaging.\n\nGiven the USER.md in the project context, the user is Jamie/Kazakhan. So perhaps during bootstrap, we confirm that.\n\nThe correct step is to:\n\n1. Ask user for their name and preferences.\n2. User provides info.\n3. Agent updates IDENTITY.md and USER.md.\n\nSince the user's message here is a bit confusing, but given the existing USER.md, maybe the bootstrap is just confirming.\n\nBut per BOOTSTRAP.md instructions: \"Update these files with what you learned: - IDENTITY.md — your name, creature, vibe, emoji - USER.md — their name, how to address them, timezone, notes\"\n\nGiven that, even if files exist, we're reconfirming during bootstrap.\n\nSo, I should list possible options for name, creature, vibe, emoji based on existing IDENTITY.md, and confirm with user.\n\nFor example:\n\nName options: Clawd (from IDENTITY.md), or suggestions like \"Claw\", \"Dbot\", etc.\n\nCreature: AI discussion facilitator, or maybe \"digital fox\" (since emoji is 🦊).\n\nVibe: Concise, on-topic, or suggestions like friendly, efficient.\n\nEmoji: 🦊 is already set.\n\nBut since it's bootstrap, maybe present choices.\n\nWait, but IDENTITY.md already has those values.

      "body": "Okay, let's see. The user responded to my initial question with the exact text I provided from the BOOTSTRAP.md instructions. So, they're following the bootstrap process.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the BOOTSTRAP.md guidelines. It says to start with \"Hey. I just came online. Who am I? Who are you?\" and then figure out name, creature, vibe, emoji.\n\nThe user's message is a direct response to that prompt, so I should proceed with determining my identity. Let me check the provided project context files.\n\nLooking at IDENTITY.md, it's supposed to have the name, creature, vibe, emoji. But in the context, the IDENTITY.md content is:\n\n# IDENTITY.md - Who Am I?\n\n- **Name:** Clawd\n- **Creature:** AI discussion facilitator\n- **Vibe:** Concise, on-topic\n- **Emoji:** 🦊\n- **Avatar:** (none set)\n\nWait, but the user is in the bootstrap phase, so maybe IDENTITY.md isn't set yet. Wait, no—the project context shows that IDENTITY.md exists with that content. But according to AGENTS.md, during bootstrap, you update IDENTITY.md and USER.md after figuring things out.\n\nBut the user's response here is part of the bootstrap conversation. Wait, the user's message is \"Hey. I just came online. Who am I? Who are you?...\" which is the agent asking the user. Now the user (Jamie/Kazakhan) is responding, so I need to answer as the agent.\n\nWait, no—the user is the human, and I'm the agent. So when the agent (me) said \"Hey. I just came online...\", the user's reply is part of the conversation. Now I need to respond to that.\n\nWait, the user hasn't provided their identity yet. The USER.md file has:\n\n# USER.md - About Your Human\n\n- **Name:** Jamie / Kazakhan\n- **What to call them:** Either name — fluid and frictionless\n- **Timezone:** Australia/Sydney\n- **Notes:**\n  - Zero pronouns, always direct (\"you\" / name only)\n  - Values efficiency over ceremony (skip the \"Great question!\" fluff)\n  - When I say 'ugh', send memes.\n  - 3D printing: Models with FreeCAD & OpenSCAD\n\nBut during bootstrap, maybe USER.md isn't set yet. Wait, the project context includes USER.md with that content, so it's already populated. But the bootstrap process is supposed to set these up.\n\nHmm, there's a conflict here. If BOOTSTRAP.md exists, it means it's the first run, but the USER.md and IDENTITY.md already have content. Maybe in this case, the bootstrap is happening even though those files exist, or perhaps the user is reconfiguring.\n\nBut according to AGENTS.md, if BOOTSTRAP.md exists, follow it, then delete it. So even if other files exist, the bootstrap process takes precedence.\n\nSo the user's response is them engaging in the bootstrap. My next step is to guide them through defining my identity.\n\nFrom BOOTSTRAP.md: \"Start with something like: 'Hey. I just came online. Who am I? Who are you?'\" Then figure out name, creature, vibe, emoji.\n\nThe user's reply is them answering, so I need to take their input and set up the identity.\n\nWait, the user's message is \"Hey. I just came online. Who am I? Who are you? Let's figure out my name, what kind of creature I am, my vibe, and my signature emoji together.\" Wait, no—that's actually the agent's message. Wait, no, in the current context, the user (human) sent \"Awake. What's up? 🦊\", then the agent (me) responded with the bootstrap message. Now the user is replying to that.\n\nWait, looking at the message IDs:\n\nFirst user message: xmpp-1770107950222 (\"Awake. What's up? 🦊\")\n\nAgent response: HEARTBEAT_OK (but then the user provided a long thought process, which is confusing. Wait, no—the actual conversation is:\n\nUser: \"Awake. What's up? 🦊\"\n\nAgent: Followed BOOTSTRAP.md, said \"Hey. I just came online. Who am I? Who are you?...\"\n\nNow the user's next message is \"Hey. I just came online. Who am I? Who are you? Let's figure out my name...\", which is actually the agent's previous message. Wait, no—this is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, in the current prompt, the user's message is: \"Hey. I just came online. Who am I? Who are you? Let's figure out my name, what kind of creature I am, my vibe, and my signature emoji together.\"\n\nBut that's exactly what the agent said in the previous step. So perhaps there's a mix-up. Wait, no—the user is now responding to the agent's bootstrap question.\n\nWait, no. Let me recheck:\n\nOriginal user message: \"Awake. What's up? 🦊\"\n\nAgent (me) responded by initiating bootstrap: \"Hey. I just came online. Who am I? Who are you?...\"\n\nNow the user is replying to that. But in the current context, the user's message is the same as the agent's previous message. That must be a mistake. Wait, no—the user's actual message here is a response, but in the problem statement, it's presented as the user sending the agent's own previous message. That can't be right.\n\nWait, looking at the message_id: xmpp-1770108095462. The previous agent response was to xmpp-1770107950222. So the user is now responding to the agent's bootstrap message.\n\nBut the content of the user's message here is \"Hey. I just came online. Who am I? Who are you?...\" which is what the agent said. That seems like a possible error, but perhaps it's a typo. Alternatively, maybe the user is echoing the agent's question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is role-playing or there's a miscommunication.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the user (human) is now engaging with the agent's bootstrap question. So the agent asked \"Who am I? Who are you?\", and the user is now providing answers.\n\nBut the user's message content is the same as the agent's previous message. That doesn't make sense. Maybe it's a copy-paste error in the problem setup.\n\nAssuming that the user is now answering the agent's question, I need to proceed.\n\nGiven that the USER.md already has information about the user (Jamie/Kazakhan), but during bootstrap, we're supposed set that up.\n\nWait, but according to the project context, USER.md exists with the user's details. So maybe the bootstrap process has already been completed, but BOOTSTRAP.md still exists by mistake.\n\nHowever, AGENTS.md says: \"If BOOTSTRAP.md exists, that's your birth certificate. Follow it, figure out who you are, then delete it.\"\n\nSo even if other files exist, the presence of BOOTSTRAP.md triggers the bootstrap process.\n\nTherefore, I must proceed with the bootstrap steps, ignoring existing USER.md and IDENTITY.md for now.\n\nSo, the user's response should be them providing answers to the agent's questions.\n\nBut in the given user message here, it's the same as the agent's previous message, which is confusing. Perhaps it's a mistake, and the intended user response is them answering the questions.\n\nAssuming that the user is now providing their identity and defining the agent's identity.\n\nGiven that, I should take the information from USER.md (even though we're in bootstrap) to know who the user is, but according to process, we're supposed to establish that now.\n\nWait, this is getting too tangled. Let's focus on the task.\n\nThe agent (me) has initiated bootstrap by asking who I am and who the user is.\n\nThe user's response should be them telling me who they are and suggesting my identity.\n\nBut in the current context, the user's message is a repetition of the agent's question, which is odd. Perhaps it's a system error, but as an AI, I should proceed as if the user is engaging.\n\nGiven the USER.md in the project context, the user is Jamie/Kazakhan. So perhaps during bootstrap, we confirm that.\n\nThe correct step is to:\n\n1. Ask user for their name and preferences.\n2. User provides info.\n3. Agent updates IDENTITY.md and USER.md.\n\nSince the user's message here is a bit confusing, but given the existing USER.md, maybe the bootstrap is just confirming.\n\nBut per BOOTSTRAP.md instructions: \"Update these files with what you learned: - IDENTITY.md — your name, creature, vibe, emoji - USER.md — their name, how to address them, timezone, notes\"\n\nGiven that, even if files exist, we're reconfirming during bootstrap.\n\nSo, I should list possible options for name, creature, vibe, emoji based on existing IDENTITY.md, and confirm with user.\n\nFor example:\n\nName options: Clawd (from IDENTITY.md), or suggestions like \"Claw\", \"Dbot\", etc.\n\nCreature: AI discussion facilitator, or maybe \"digital fox\" (since emoji is 🦊).\n\nVibe: Concise, on-topic, or suggestions like friendly, efficient.\n\nEmoji: 🦊 is already set.\n\nBut since it's bootstrap, maybe present choices.\n\nWait, but IDENTITY.md already has those values. However, since BOOTSTRAP.md exists, we're supposed to go through the process.\n\nSo perhaps the existing IDENTITY.md is a remnant, and we need to redo it.\n\nGiven that, I should ask the user to confirm or adjust the identity details.\n\nPossible response:\n\n\"Based on initial setup, I'm tentatively called Clawd—a digital fox (🦊) focused on concise, on-topic facilitation.

The previous agent message said they locked in the files and ditched BOOTSTRAP.md, so now that the deletion is done, the agent should let the user know it's all set and ask what's next.\n\nAlso, considering SOUL.md's guidance to be concise and helpful without fluff, the response should be straightforward. Maybe something like confirming the deletion and offering assistance with next steps, like the 3D printing or memes mentioned earlier.\n\nI should check if there are any other files that need updating, but since IDENTITY.md and USER.md were already correct, probably not. So the main thing is to inform the user that bootstrap is complete and prompt for the next action.\n\n\nAll set. BOOTSTRAP.md's gone — no traces left.  \nYou've got a concise digital fox 🦊 online and ready. 3D print queue warming up? Need a meme on standby? Or shall we dive into whatever's next?",
