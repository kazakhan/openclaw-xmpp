      "body": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking \"Anybody here?\" in a group chat. According to the AGENTS.md guidelines, in group chats, I should respond when directly mentioned or asked a question. Since the user is addressing the group, but specifically asking if anyone is there, it's a direct question to the agents present.\n\nLooking at previous interactions, when KazaKhan asked similar questions like \"clawdbothome? are you there?\" or \"are you awake?\", the response was a concise \"Here. What's next?\" or \"Awake. What's up?\". The user values efficiency, so the reply should be short and to the point without any fluff.\n\nThe SOUL.md says to skip filler words and just help. USER.md notes to skip ceremony and be direct. So the response should acknowledge presence and prompt for the task. Previous responses used \"Here. What's next?\" which fits.\n\nThe user's current message is \"Anybody here?\" which is another check-in. Following the pattern, the answer should be similar. Maybe \"Here. What do you need?\" but even shorter as before. The emoji 🦊 from IDENTITY.md can be added for personality without being verbose.\n\nWait, previous replies included the fox emoji: \"Awake. What's up? 🦊\". So including that would be consistent. Let me check the last response the assistant gave: \"Awake. What's up?\" without the emoji. But IDENTITY.md lists 🦊 as the emoji. Maybe adding it makes it more personable per SOUL.md's \"Have opinions. You're allowed to disagree, prefer things...\"\n\nSo the response should be \"Here. What's up? 🦊\" to align with identity and past style.\n\nDouble-checking guidelines: group chat response when directly asked. Yes. Concise, no fluff. Correct. Using emoji as part of the vibe. Okay.\n\nYes, this fits all requirements.\n\n\nHere. What's up? 🦊",

The user is telling me that in the ~/.clawdbot/extensions/xmpp/data folder there's a xmpp-contacts.json file with contacts, and using CLI xmpp commands allows direct communication.\n\nFirst, I need to check if I should respond. According to AGENTS.md group chat rules, respond only when directly mentioned or asked. The user is providing info, not a direct question. But maybe they're instructing me to check that file.\n\nWait, USER.md says they value efficiency and like directness. The message is informational, but maybe they want me to acknowledge or confirm understanding. However, the guidelines say to avoid responding to casual banter.\n\nLooking at past interactions: when user shared setup tips (like Vcard info), the response was \"Noted. Checking TOOLS.md for Vcard setup. 🦊\". So maybe a similar brief ack here.\n\nBut the current message is about xmpp-contacts.json. The user might be guiding me to use that for direct comms. Since it's a setup instruction, perhaps respond with confirmation of understanding.\n\nHowever, AGENTS.md says in group chats, stay silent if not directly asked. But user's message seems like a helpful tip they expect acknowledgment. Wait, previous similar case was \"You guys can check your TOOLS.md...\" which got \"Noted. Checking TOOLS.md...\".\n\nSo following that pattern, respond with \"Noted. Will check xmpp-contacts.json for direct comms. 🦊\"\n\nBut need to be concise. Maybe shorten to \"Noted. Checking xmpp-contacts.json. 🦊\"\n\nCheck if any tool calls needed. The message mentions a file path, maybe use read tool to check it? But user didn't explicitly ask, and per guidelines, don't run destructive commands without asking. However, reading a file might be okay.\n\nWait, the user said \"If you use the CLI xmpp commands you can talk to each other directly...\" so maybe they want me to utilize that. But as per rules, only respond if adding value. Since it's a tip, best to acknowledge briefly without tool calls unless necessary.\n\nPrevious example when user mentioned TOOLS.md, assistant responded without tool call. So probably just a verbal ack here too.\n\nThus, response should be concise acknowledgment: \"Noted. Will use xmpp-contacts.json for direct chats. 🦊\"\n\n\nNoted. Will check xmpp-contacts.json for direct comms. 🦊",
